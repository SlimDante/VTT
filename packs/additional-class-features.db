You have 2 essentia, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Incarnate table. Normally, you can never have more essentia than shown on the table for your level, however there are racial features, spells, feats, and even magic items that increase your essentia pool maximum temporarily or permanently.</p>\n<p>There are multiple important terms when dealing with essentia. Invest, expend, reallocate, divest.</p>\n<p>Invest<br />When you remove essentia from your essentia pool and put it to a soulmeld, this is investing essentia. Soulmelds with essentia invested in them can gain bonus effects, while others may just store essentia to be expended at a time you deem necessary.<br /><br />Expend<br />The act of removing essentia from a soulmeld in order to use a soulmeld's ability is known as expending essentia. Soulmelds with this feature tend to be worded \"when you expend essentia invested in this soulmeld\" or some similar wording. It is important to note that once expended, essentia does not return to your essentia pool.<br /><br />Reallocate<br />Reallocating essentia is simple, it is the act of removing essentia from one soulmeld and putting it directly into another soulmeld. You can reallocate essentia to soulmelds that have essentia invested in them already, however you cannot reallocate essentia into a soulmeld that already has its essentia maximum invested, such as trying to invest six essentia into a soulmeld that can only contain five essentia.</p>\n<p>Divest<br />Divesting essentia is the act of removing it from a soulmeld for no benefit. Divested essentia does not return to your essentia pool. If you choose to divest essentia from one of your soulmelds instead of expending it, you do not gain any abilities the soulmeld might grant for expending essentia. This same rule applie if a creature has a spell or feature that divests essentia from your soulmelds.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can choose to invest essentia into a soulmeld, or divest essentia from a soulmeld. As an action you can reallocate essentia from one soulmeld to another. Up to 5 essentia can be invested into a single soulmeld unless otherwise stated.</p>\n<p>When you invest essentia into a soulmeld, it is removed your from essentia pool and remains in the soulmeld until you choose to expend, divest, or reallocate it. When essentia is removed from a soulmeld by force, it is divested. Several soulmelds allow you to expend essentia, a process that removes the essentia from the soulmeld, granting temporary boosts in power. Essentia can remain invested in a Soulmeld for one hour, any essentia not used within that time dissipates into the air. Once essentia has been removed from the essentia pool for any reason, it cannot return to the pool until you finish a long rest, when you regain all spent essentia.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Book of Incarnum","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"1st Level Incarnate","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_22.jpg","effects":[]}
