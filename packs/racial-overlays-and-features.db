You and your coven members can participate in coven spellcasting. You have a spell list and a number of coven spell slots dictated by your coven type, as shown in the tables below. The coven uses the spellcasting ability modifier and spell save DC of the coven member with the highest Charsima score. When the coven casts a spell from their coven spell list, they expend slots from their shared pool instead of their own.</p>\n<p>On one of the coven members' turns, when all three coven members are within 30 feet of each other and capable of performing verbal and somatic components, they can initiate a coven spell as a reaction. The other two members of the coven must then expend their reaction to participate. If all three members are participating, then the member who initiated the casting can choose and cast one spell from their shared list, expending the appropriate shared spell slots. The coven spell slot being used must be of a level for which all members of the coven have spell slots. If the spell requires material components, any member of the coven can be in possession of the components. If the spell requires concentration, any member of the coven can choose to concentrate on it after it is cast.</p>\n<p>For example, A hag that is a 7th level sorcerer can cast spells of 4th level or lower from her own spell list. She has entered into a Death coven with a 7th level wizard, who also has 4th level spell slots, and a 7th level ranger who only has 1st and 2nd level slots. The coven can therefore only cast spells of 1st or 2nd level from their shared spell list.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Any expended coven spell slots are recovered when all three coven members complete a 3 hour ritual.
